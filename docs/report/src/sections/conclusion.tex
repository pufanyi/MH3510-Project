\section{Conclusion}

Our single variable regression analysis showed that population size and the number of lanes significantly predict AADT, consistent with expectations that larger populations and additional lanes increase traffic capacity. However, road width was found to have a weak and statistically insignificant relationship with AADT. Access control demonstrated a substantial impact on traffic, as shown through a two-group comparison where controlled access increased AADT.

In the multiple linear regression model, we incorporated these significant factors, refining our understanding of how they collectively influence traffic patterns. This comprehensive approach provides a clearer picture of the primary determinants of traffic volume and informs infrastructure planning decisions. 

And finally, we provide our prediction in Equation \ref{eq:prediction} and \ref{eq:conf}.
